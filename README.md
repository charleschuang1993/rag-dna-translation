This repository demonstrates how to apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the accuracy of large language models when translating raw DNA sequences into amino acid chains. By indexing a curated codon table (and, optionally, other biological knowledge sources) as a vector store, the system retrieves precise codon-to-amino-acid mappings at inference time. The language model then focuses solely on sequence segmentation and formattingâ€”drastically reducing hallucination errors and boosting overall translation fidelity.
